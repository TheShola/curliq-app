Installation
	Pre-Installation 
		- CURL IQ is built on Expo
		- Expo apps are React Native apps which contain the Expo SDK. The SDK is a native-and-JS library which provides access to the device's system functionality (things like the camera, contacts, local storage, and other hardware). That means you don't need to use Xcode or Android Studio, or write any native code, and it also makes your pure-JS project very portable because it can run in any native environment containing the Expo SDK.
		
		- Follow this - https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/installation.html

TODO: 
		- git clone repo
		- npm install or yarn start 
		- yarn add react-native
